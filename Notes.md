# Hacking and the Academy

These are raw notes, often snippets from documents I'm reading. Assume everything is an unattributed quote from somewhere/someone else!

## Intro: Recent hacking and cracking
* 20 years ago, Linux began as the work of a student. 5th October 1991. Called it a 'nice learning tool'. Hosted at Helsinki university, MIT, Germany?
## History: Hacking in the academy
* Began 1961 at MIT AI Lab. First to refer to themselves as 'hackers'.
* 'Hacks' originally referred to "elaborate but harmless pranks" (Raymond, 2004, 44)
* 1969: ARPANET joined up hackers from different universities, such as Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon. Origins of a shared (academic) culture. 
* Took on the responsibility of running the early Internet and formed groups such as IETF. Not corporate types but grubby hippies. Later called 'geeks' or 'nerds'.
* ARPANET hackers influenced by the academic 'publish or perish' imperative. Collaboration and sharing of source code. Idealism of 'networked community of minds'. cf. Cybernetic influence. Turner, 2006. (Raymond 2004, 45)
* Stallman and Free Software Foundation (1980s). Led to a hacker consciousness and identity/ethic. MIT AI Lab as "hacker's paradise" (Moody, 2001, 15). 
* X Windows (MIT) is example of commercial interests working with academic hackers. 
* First web server (HTTP daemon) was created by Rob McCool at the University of Illinois and grew into Apache, which now serves 63% of all websites.
* Sendmail was created by Eric Allman at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1980s. Runs approx. 30% of mail servers worldwide.
* ViolaWWW was the first (1992) graphical web browser, developed by a student called Pei-Yuan Wei, at the University of California, Berkeley.
* Torvald's Linux was developed while he was at Helsinki University (1991) as a second year computer science student. Used his student loan to buy a PC to develop Linux on, rather than food or rent.
* Tanenbaum created Minix at The Free University of Amsterdam (1984). Created for educational purposes to work on the PC
* What do commercial companies do when they want to promote a culture of research? Create 'campuses' like those at Xerox PARC, founded by Dr. George Pake, who left his position as Provost of the University of Washington to become founding director of PARC.
* Apple Campus, Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus, Googleplex
* Cisco, Google, Sun, etc. all grew out of hacker created enterprises. 
## The Hacker Ethic: What distinguishes hacking?
* Hacking and academic freedom
* Hacking as "playful cleverness" (Stallman)
* Hacking & Open Source (1998): Intellectual Property?
* Hardware hacking
* Open web and peer-production
* "From Jargon file: "Hacker Ethic": "The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible."
* "Hacker Attitude": 
1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
4. Freedom is good.
5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.
* "Hacker": 
1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users’ Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.
3. A person capable of appreciating hack value.
4. A person who is good at programming quickly.
5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in ‘a Unix hacker’. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)
6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.
7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.
8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence password hacker, network hacker. The correct term for this sense is cracker.
* Self-directed learning
* "Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software. Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control. Good hackers insist on control. This is part of what makes them good hackers: when something's broken, they need to fix it." (Paul Graham, Great Hackers, 2004)
* Read what Paul Graham describes as 'Great Hackers' and you could be forgiven for picturing an academic in their office. They clump together in research groups to be around like-minded people, they style their office after their home, they're dedicated to problem solving through something that blends both work and play.
* "With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good hackers when you meet them. I can't tell, even now. You also can't tell from their resumes. It seems like the only way to judge a hacker is to work with him on something.
* And this is the reason that high-tech areas only happen around universities. The active ingredient here is not so much the professors as the students. Startups grow up around universities because universities bring together promising young people and make them work on the same projects. The smart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together they cook up new projects of their own." (Paul Graham, Great Hackers, 2004)
* "The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like. When I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have in common is the extreme difficulty of making them work on anything they don't want to. I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be both. To do something well you have to love it. So to the extent you can preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it well." (Paul Graham, Great Hackers, 2004)
* "What should you do in college to become a good hacker? There are two main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn a lot about specific, cool problems. These turn out to be equivalent, because each drives you to do the other." (Paul Graham, Undergraduation, 2005)
* Linus: Hackers not motivated by money but by doing something interesting and receiving peer-recognition (sociality).
* "interesting", "enthusiasm", "joyful", "playful", not bound by the work-day schedule. Self-organised. Hatred of bureaucracy. Meritocracy.
* "The Hacker view is that the use of machines for the optimisation and flexibility of time should lead to a life for human beings that is less machinelike - less optimised and routine." (Himanen, The Hacker Ethic, 2001, 15).
* "Historically, this freedom to self-organise time again has a precursor in the academy. The academy has always defended a person's freedom to organise time oneself. Plato defined the academic relation to time by saying that a free person has *skhole*, that is 'plenty of time. When he talks, he talks in peace and quiet, and his time is his own.'… A person living an academic life could organise one's time oneself - the person could combine work and leisure in the way he wanted." (Hinamen, 2001, 33-34)
* Hacking is about collectively creating social value, things of utility. Things that are **useful**.
* cf. Stallman's 'Free Software Song'.
* Raymond's 'bazaar' model is the academic model of enquiry and open peer-review.
* Open Source -> Open Access -> Open Education
* Similar learning methods: Hinamen calls it the 'net academy': "It is a continuously evolving learning environment created by the learners themselves. The learning model adopted by hackers has many advantages. In the hacker world, the teachers or assemblers of information sources are often those who have just learned something. … this hacker model resembles Plato's Academy, where students were not regarded as targets for knowledge transmission but were referred to as companions in learning (*synetheis*). In the Academy's view, the central task of teaching was to strengthen the learners' ability to pose problems, develop lines of thought, and present criticism. As a result, the teacher was metaphorically referred to as a midwife, a matchmaker, and a master of ceremonies at banquets. It was not the teacher's task to inculcate the students with pre-established knowledge but to help them give birth to things from their own starting points." (Hinamen, 2001, 75) Same in Hacker community. ???
* Ironic that "the current academy tends to model its learning structure on the monastic sender-receiver model. The irony is usually only amplified when the academy starts to build a 'virtual university': the result is a computerised monastery-school." (Hinamen, 2001, 76)
* "The core of the academy does not consist of its individual achievements but of the academic model itself." (Hinamen, 2001, 79). See this section for more on Net Academy.
* Hinamen: Seven Values of the Hacker Ethic:
1. Passion
2. Freedom
3. Social worth
4. Openness
5. Activity
6. Caring
7. Creativity
* Hackers desire knowledge not education. Education is an induction into wage slavery. (Wark, 2004, 055)
* True Hackers express themselves through knowledge not through what their education represents.
* "To hack is to express knowledge in any of its forms. Hacker knowledge implies, in its practice, a politics of free information, free learning, the gift of the result in a peer-to-peer network. Hacker knowledge also implies an ethics of knowledge open to the desires of the productive classes and free from subordination to commodity production. Hacker knowledge is knowledge that expresses the virtuality of nature, by transforming it, fully aware of the bounty and danger. When knowledge is freed from scarcity, the free production of knowledge becomes the knowledge of free producers. This may sound like utopia, but the accounts of actually existing temporary zones of hacker liberty are legion. Stallman: 'It was a bit like the garden of Eden. It hadn't occurred to us not to co-operate." (Wark, 2004, 070) 
* "A hack touches the virtual - and transforms the actual. 'To qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity." (Wark, 2004, 071) Quoting Levy.
* "The nature of any and every domain may be hacked. It is in the nature of hacking to discover freely, to invent freely, to create and produce freely. But it is not in the nature of hacking itself to exploit the abstractions thus produced." (Wark, 2004, 075) i.e. against cracking/exploits
* "Warriors of everyday technological determinism. They hack to resist being technologically determined themselves and to reform technologies so there are new determinations." (Jordan, 2008, 14)
* "Hackers are the warriors of the information  society because they constantly grapple with the everyday determinations of information technologies." (Jordan, 2008, 16)
* Technology is socially determined, yet on an everyday level, we are constantly subjected to technological determinisms. They hack the "sedimented sociality of a technology." (Jordan, 2008, 16). They are at the heart of the information society, re-determining the way technology sediments our everyday lives. 
* Open source hackers freely choose their work. Characterised by a 'gift economy'.
* Open source is concerned with the right to distribute property rather than the right to exclude people from it. 
* Stallman laments the time when hackers moved away from the university to work in companies that required NDAs. 
* Open Access is similarly a movement to "reconfigure property as distribution rather than exclusion." The rights to access. (Jordan, 2008, 63)
* "a movement that uses collective action to grapple constantly and directly with the nature of software and technological determinations that exist, might exist and have been overcome in software." (Jordan, 2008, 64)
* Open source refers to open peer-review of software code (written text).
* "Hackers see hacking as social change." (Jordan, 2008, 97)
* Predecessor of CC licenses is Stallman's GFDL.
* Not all programmers are hackers. Hackers are programmers who opt to hack on software of their choice. They scratch their own itch, rather than their institution's.
* Much like academics in their autonomy, gift culture.
* Corporations are attempting to re-create the culture of innovation found in universities through the development of 'campuses'. Google goes further and allows 20% time and the development of open source projects in an attempt to cultivate the university hacker environment. "These, and other indications, give all the signs of freedom, particularly in their invocation of university life, that is fundamentally absent from the programmers at Micrsoft, who programme to the needs of Microsoft and not to their own needs of the perceived needs of society or software." (Jordan, 2008, 114).
* "Whereas hackers engage with technological determinations of their choice and in their own ways, programmers are told by their corporations which technologies to engage with, under the ultimate aim of generating profit for the corporation. There should be nothing surprising about this, as it is the basic bargain nearly all employees in all industries strike, but it also distinguishes the vast majority of programmers from hackers." (Jordan, 2008, 116)
* Problem of technological determinism in universities. Educational software is uninspiring. Little 'learning' takes place in the 'Virtual Learning Environment'. 
* "Hacking assumes both that technology determines society and society determines technology. The conceptual difficulty hacking poses is the simultaneous separation and merging of technology and society, in a context where each is held to be able to determine the other. It is this complexity that hacking has at its heart and which defines hacking." (JOrdan, 2008, 134).

# Hacking as a craft
* Teacher-(grad)student apprenticeship. 
* Hackers as pedagogues. 
* Workmanship of risk/certainty? Risk as it is human interpretive skill, certainty as it both has to build and can be subject to various tests. 
* Software Engineering aims for workmanship of certainty but remains workmanship of risk in almost every instance. Software Craftsmanship is the workmanship of risk that is regulated. What place for diversity?
* Compare software development with Potter, Blacksmith, Cobbler. In most cases, all are workmanship of risk to different degrees.
